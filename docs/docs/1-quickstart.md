# Quickstart

After following the Installation instructions, you can run the application by
running the following commands in the root directory of the project to start the
frontend and the backend.

Frontend:

```bash
cd goal-tracker
npm run start
```

To have a better understanding of the workings of the application I suggest to
start the backend in another terminal.

Backend:

```bash
cd server
npm run start
```
